# Python + PostgreSQL Data Processing and Analysis

This project demonstrates how to use Python with PostgreSQL for data processing, storage, querying, and statistical analysis. It supports complex SQL queries (WITH AS, window functions, JOINs, etc.) to handle large datasets efficiently.

Complex SQL: JOIN + Statistical Analysis
Using Window Functions to Calculate Cumulative Sales Share

üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install psycopg2 pandas sqlalchemy
psycopg2 - PostgreSQL connection
pandas - Data manipulation
sqlalchemy - Database operations

üîó Connecting to PostgreSQL

Use SQLAlchemy to connect to PostgreSQL:

from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# PostgreSQL connection details
DB_NAME = "your_database"
USER = "your_username"
PASSWORD = "your_password"
HOST = "your_host"  # Example: 'localhost'
PORT = "5432"  # Default PostgreSQL port

# Create database engine
engine = create_engine(f'postgresql://{USER}:{PASSWORD}@{HOST}:{PORT}/{DB_NAME}')

# Test connection
try:
    conn = engine.connect()
    print("‚úÖ Successfully connected to PostgreSQL!")
    conn.close()
except Exception as e:
    print("‚ùå Connection failed:", e)
üìä Storing a Pandas DataFrame in PostgreSQL
If you have a pre-processed Pandas DataFrame, you can store it in PostgreSQL using to_sql():

import pandas as pd
# Sample DataFrame
df_cleaned = pd.DataFrame({
    'id': [1, 2, 3],
    'product': ['Laptop', 'Mouse', 'Keyboard'],
    'price': [1000, 20, 50],
    'quantity': [2, 10, 5]
})

# Store in PostgreSQL
df_cleaned.to_sql("data", engine, if_exists="replace", index=False)

üìù SQL Query Examples
Using WITH AS for Stepwise Calculation
Calculate total revenue for each product and rank them based on sales:

WITH revenue_table AS (
    SELECT 
        product, 
        SUM(price * quantity) AS total_revenue
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY product
)
SELECT 
    product, 
    total_revenue,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_revenue DESC) AS revenue_rank
FROM revenue_table;

üöÄ Summary
‚úÖ Best Practices for Python + PostgreSQL:

Preprocess data using Python
Store Pandas DataFrames in PostgreSQL with to_sql()
Query and analyze data using SQL
Use advanced SQL techniques (WITH AS, JOIN, window functions) for efficient analysis
Run SQL queries directly in Python using pandas.read_sql()
